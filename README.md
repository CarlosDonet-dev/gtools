## Why gtools?

Git commands are powerful but often verbose and sometimes hard to remember.  
**gtools** offers friendly, short commands ‚Äî like `gbranch` ‚Äî that run your usual Git operations,  
but with improved, clean, human-readable outputs designed for developers who want clarity without complexity.

---

## Features

- Intuitive short commands wrapping common Git operations
- Enhanced output formatting and spinners for better UX
- Smart branch grouping (`feat/`, `fix/`, `release/`, etc.) with clear color-coded sections
- Interactive config setup with `gconfig`
- Fun extras like `gchill` to take a break with nerdy quotes ‚òï
- Easy install/uninstall via npm scoped package
- Written in TypeScript with minimal dependencies (`ora`, `execa`, etc.)
